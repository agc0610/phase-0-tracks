# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a method for tracking the evolution of a code base and a strategy for managing several developers' work in one place. It is useful because it allows one to go back to the most recent working version in the event of a major bug introduced into the code, and it also allows there to be organization when several programmers are working at the same time.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a separate but related workspace to a master code base. You would use one to do your work without disrupting the main, working code.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is adding your code changes to the repository for review. A good commit message clearly and succinctly states what you have done, typically in present command tense.
* What is a merge conflict?
Typically a merge means committing something with changes to a base commit against which a comparison is made to determine said changes (so only the merge has changed information). A merge conflict arises when there is ambiguity about what changes have been made because both files have changed information.
