    <p>Option one is boring and you should not choose this one. This is why option two has both rankings.</p>

  <!--html semantic tags improve accessibility for people who use screen readers. The tags give them a better sense of the kind of content they will consume. I think nav and section are most useful; they denote enough difference in the content without being overly semantic, and organizing by sections makes it easier to skip to the desired one (as long as good IDs are used).
  Typically the browser displays elements from top to bottom.
  I learned about snippets in Sublime! I had not used those before. I can't say if I would or wouldn't make more later, but I'm sure it will come in handy to know how.
  The most difficult concept in this challenge was the fact that I had to do it by myself. This is the second time I have had a glitch with the GPS assignment that is not in my control, and it is frustrating since I am being asked to make time in my schedule and then I don't get the full experience. Even though I have a lot of experience with HTML I value learning from others' perspectives.
